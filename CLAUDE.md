# Bot Strike — project context

Browser FPS built with Three.js. No game engine: the browser is the runtime,
Three.js does rendering, and physics/collision/netcode are hand-written.

**Owner:** Jack. Address him as Jack.

## Layout

```
GG aims/
├── fps-game.html      # standalone single-player range (older, less featured)
├── mp/                # THE MAIN GAME — work here
│   ├── server.js      # Node + Socket.IO authoritative server
│   └── public/
│       ├── index.html # the whole client (render, UI, netcode, gameplay)
│       └── assets/    # models + textures
└── extras/            # parked features (see slide-ability.md)
```

Almost all work happens in **`mp/public/index.html`** and **`mp/server.js`**.

## Running it

```bash
cd mp
npm install        # first time only
npm start          # http://localhost:8200
```

Kill a stuck server with `taskkill //F //IM node.exe`. The server can take
~5s to bind; the first `curl` often returns 000 — retry before assuming failure.

## Deployment

- GitHub: https://github.com/kingdod26-blip/GG-aims- (private)
- Live: https://bot-strike.onrender.com
- `render.yaml` is a Render blueprint; **`git push` auto-deploys**.
- Free tier sleeps after ~15 min idle (first load ~30–60s).

## Architecture

- **Damage is server-authoritative** (hitscan, arrows, melee all resolved in
  `server.js`). Movement is client-authoritative — cheatable, accepted tradeoff.
- Client sends `state {x,z,y,yaw,pitch,st}` at ~30Hz; server broadcasts a
  snapshot of players, bots and arrows at 30Hz.
- Two modes: **Target Practice** (offline, client simulates) and
  **Multiplayer** (server simulates). Shared gameplay numbers must be kept in
  sync between `WEAPONS` (client) and `XBOW`/`MELEE`/`STANCE_BOX` (server).
- Bots are **stationary targets** by design — they don't move or shoot.
- The arena is **indoors**: flat dark backdrop, fog on the same value, a
  ceiling at `WH`, and unlit emissive panels standing in for ceiling lamps.
  There is no sky and no sun.
- **The Spartan is the player avatar**, not the bots. Bots are the cheap
  procedural box humanoids (`humanoid()`) on purpose: stationary targets
  don't earn the detail, and eight boxes cost nearly nothing.

## Features

Weapons (`1`–`5`): rifle, sniper (4× scope), shotgun (8 pellets), 2 pistols.
`G` crossbow ability — 2 charges, 30s each, flaming arrow, 90 dmg + 6/s burn.
Two separate fire lifetimes: a **person** burns for `burnMs` (5s), while the
**pool the arrow leaves on the ground** lasts `GFIRE.ms` (9s). A pool is
dropped wherever the arrow ends up — floor, foot of a wall, or under whoever
it hit. Right-click toggles ricochet (bounces off geometry once).
`F` blade — 5-hit combo 22/22/28/28/70, resets on miss.
Both now use real models (`assets/crossbow.fbx`, `assets/sword.fbx`). Each
arrives as one mesh with one material, so `splitGeometryByAxis` cuts the
triangles into material groups along the model's long axis — limbs/stock for
the crossbow, grip/guard/blade for the sword. The procedural versions are
still there and stay on screen until the files load, or if a load fails.
`V` roll (~7m, 1.2s cd, camera leans `ROLL.lean` = 0.22 rad / ~12° on a
sideways roll, 0 on a forward one). Double jump. Sprint (Shift). Stances: `C` crouch,
`Z` prone — these shrink your server-side hitbox.
`Tab` armory, `O` graphics settings, `Esc` pause/quit.

## Gotchas discovered the hard way

- **`object.position` is read-only** in this Three.js build —
  `Object.assign(mesh,{position:...})` throws. Use `.position.set()`.
- **Additive blending is invisible** against bright backgrounds. The fire bug
  was exactly this. Use solid materials with opacity.
- **Tone mapping and the HDR environment were deliberately removed** (Jack's
  call). Because of that, **metalness must stay at 0** — metal with nothing to
  reflect renders black. Don't reintroduce `envMap`/`metalness` without an env.
- **Don't add point lights casually** — with no tone mapping they blow the
  ground out to white discs.
- Character models face **+Z**, and every place we aim one already accounts
  for it: remote players get `yaw + PI`, and bots get `atan2(dx,dz)`, which
  points +Z at you. So **no extra per-model flip is needed** — `SPARTAN_FACE`
  is 0. It used to be `Math.PI`, which corrected an already-corrected angle
  and showed you the Spartan's back.
- **Replacement materials on a SkinnedMesh need `skinning: true`.** Build a
  fresh `MeshStandardMaterial` for a rigged model and it defaults to false,
  the GPU ignores the bones, and the model renders in its raw bind pose —
  standing there with its arms out. The shadow pass warns once per mesh per
  frame, which also floods the console.
- **Sketchfab FBX exports carry junk**: the Spartan ships a display
  groundplane mesh named `Floor` (drop it, or every player drags a 2.3m disc
  around) and references three `.dds` IBL cubemaps that aren't in the
  download. `fbxTexMgr` redirects those and the crossbow's missing palette
  JPG to a 1px blank so they don't 404.
- **Force `metalness = 0` on anything loaded from a file.** `fitWeaponModel`
  does this now — the sniper's GLB arrived at 0.4 and rendered dark.
- `requestPointerLock()` returns a promise that rejects in embedded frames —
  always go through `lockPointer()`.
- Viewmodel holders are built from `WEAPONS`, not the model-file list. A new
  weapon needs a holder or every model vanishes when you equip it.
- Dispose **both** geometry and material on throwaway meshes (tracer leak).
- **Put fire out through `extinguish()`, never by zeroing `burnUntil`.** The
  burn loop skips dead bots, so a bot killed mid-burn kept its fx group
  parented to its mesh and `respawnLocalBot` made that mesh visible again —
  it came back permanently alight. Every kill path has to call it.
- **Don't let the ceiling cast shadows.** A shadow-casting lid between the key
  light and the floor drops the entire room to black.

## Testing notes

Verify in the browser via `javascript_tool`, not by eyeballing. Two traps:
- Calling `loop()` synchronously gives `dt ≈ 0`, so anything time-smoothed
  (FOV, stance, velocity) won't move. Force a timestep:
  `frameGate=0; last=performance.now()-16; loop();`
- Set `SETTINGS.fpsCap = 0` first or the frame limiter skips your frames.
- Reset ability state (`rollT`, `slideT`, cooldowns) between checks — leftover
  state silently invalidates results.

## Parked / possible next

- **Slide is disabled** behind `SLIDE_ENABLED` — see `extras/slide-ability.md`.
- Ground fire is **cosmetic**: standing in a pool doesn't hurt you. Making it
  damage anyone who walks through is a server change (`burnTick`).
- The crossbow's CreativeTrio palette texture wasn't in the download, so it's
  flat two-tone (limbs vs stock). A palette JPG would give it real colour.
- Never built: a real fail state. Bots don't shoot, so you can't lose. Wave
  survival + a difficulty toggle is the biggest remaining gameplay gap.
- Sound is synthesized; Jack finds it weak. Real `.mp3` files would help.
